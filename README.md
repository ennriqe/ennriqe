# Enrique Barrueco Mikelarena - Data Scientist

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Enrique Barrueco, a passionate Data Scientist deeply interested in data-driven decision-making, predictive modeling, and crypto. My journey in data science has been shaped by a combination of strong academic foundations, practical experience, and a relentless curiosity to explore new technologies.

## Side Projects

### [PunkPredictor.xyz](https://punkpredictor.xyz)
PunkPredictor.xyz is a subscription site that gives its users access to the most accurate CryptoPunk price prediction model. It leverages a deep neural network with an in-production median absolute percent error of 6.89%. Users also gain access to valuation intervals generated using conformal predictions and valuation reports created using explainable AI.

### [DFKData.io](https://dfkdata.io)
DFKData.io is a detailed dashboard embedded in a site that provides price and supply analytics for DeFi Kingdoms, a GameFi project. The data is directly queried from the DFK and Kaia blockchains, GraphQL, and various APIs.

## üèÜ Hackathons

### ü•á zkML Gizathon (February 2024)
We developed a ZK-verifiable model to predict the fair price of CryptoPunks, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy (1-MAPE). This project won the first prize for the best AI action, securing $3.5k.

### ü•á ETHDAM (April 2024)
At ETHDAM, I contributed to building a model that uses newly minted ERC20 contract data to predict market cap success. This project won the Slither Track and earned a $1K prize.

### ü•â GIZA & GORA AI COMPETITION (May 2024)
In this Kaggle-style competition, our team predicted the default of over-collateralized crypto loans, securing the 3rd prize with a $750 reward.

### ü•á ETHGlobal Brussels (July 2024)
We developed an innovative app for fully private melanoma consultations using a picture. The neural network was hosted on the Nillion Testnet, and the app won the first prize in the Best Blind AI App category, along with $3k.


## üìÑ Published Papers

During my time working as a student assistant for Maastricht University, I contributed to two significant research projects, resulting in published papers:

- **Dark Web Market Scraping:** Scraped 12 Dark Web markets to identify compromised student accounts of the university. [Read the paper here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-06975-8_28).

- **Crypto Donations Chrome Extension:** Participated in the development of a JavaScript Chrome extension that facilitates crypto donations to content creators. [Read the paper here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9909272/).
